> What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.

## Books that I am reading, have read, or will read
The shelf here acts as my public reading log. I capture short reactions, highlights I want to bring back to the lab, and the occasional quote that sneaks into my talks.

### Current rotation

- **Evaluation playbooks** · Technical books on measurement, auditing, and field experiments inform how I design AI interventions for public organizations.
- **Design + governance** · Essays on civic futures, digital infrastructure, and service design remind me to keep bureaucratic realities in scope.
- **Korean fiction** · Translated and original works help me stay fluent and give me language for the cultural nuance that shows up in my data stories.

### 3 perennial favorites

1. **"Seeing Like a State" — James C. Scott** · For questioning every dashboard that crosses my desk.
2. **"The Loneliest Americans" — Jay Caspian Kang** · For remembering how policy debates land on real people.
3. **"Kim Ji-young, Born 1982" — Cho Nam-joo** · For grounding gendered data anecdotes in lived experience.

### To-read queue

- Papers overflow my backlog, so I keep a short queue of books that stretch me beyond code: a deep dive into participatory budgeting, another on multimodal rhetoric, and at least one collection of poetry to recharge.
