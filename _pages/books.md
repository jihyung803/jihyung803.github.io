> What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.

## Books that I am reading, have read, or will read

Alignment research can turn into a wall of papers and Slack logs, so books keep me grounded. I rotate between technical texts on evaluation, philosophy that reframes urban systems, and Korean fiction that reminds me why nuance matters. The reviews here double as reading notes I share with labmates.

### Themes I'm exploring right now

- **Pragmatics + NLP**: linguistics and communication theory around ambiguity.
- **Responsible AI**: nonfiction on alignment, governance, and deployment.
- **Resilience in fiction**: novels and essays that help me find balance during messy research seasons.
