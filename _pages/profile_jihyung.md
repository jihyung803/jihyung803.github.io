I'm a CS Ph.D. student at UT Austin focusing on LLM alignment and lead researcher for the Civic Agents Observatory. My work trains pragmatic RLHF systems so models spot ambiguity in resident requests and agency memos before replying.

**Focus**

- Pragmatic RL & preference modeling for bilingual datasets
- Safety evaluation pipelines for Austin 3-1-1 and other public-service assistants
- Participatory design sessions and community workshops

**Fun fact**

Weekend hobby: mapping every Austin coffee shop in a notebook that somehow doubles as inspiration for new alignment checklists.
