Hi, I'm **Jihyung Park**. I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UT Austin working with Good Systems and the Urban Information Lab. My research designs civic-minded alignment pipelines so conversational models learn to navigate the pragmatic rules that residents and public servants actually use. I combine LLM alignment, pragmatics, ambiguity modeling, and safety evaluation workflows to support participatory policymaking.

## What I'm focused on now

- **Pragmatic RLHF**: shaping reward models so agents learn when to ask clarifying questions based on Austin 3-1-1 logs and council documents.
- **Civic Agents Observatory**: co-leading deployments with Austin's 3-1-1 counselors to evaluate trustworthy LLM assistants before they reach residents.
- **Bilingual evaluation harness**: releasing open-source pipelines that keep Korean/English datasets aligned with the same safety bar.

## Values / keywords

- Alignment & Safety, Ambiguity, Responsible Deployment, Participatory Design, RLHF, Model Governance

## Ways to collaborate

- Pilot a model with municipal or community partners and deliver a safety assessment before launch.
- Share pragmatic RL/ alignment stack lessons in seminars or guest lectures.
- Mentor students through the UT Austin Alignment Reading Group and WiCSE research program.
