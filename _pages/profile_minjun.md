### Minjun Lee

Minjun is an ML engineer at a Seoul-based mobility & climate-tech startup and provides the industrial testbed for my research. He ports our alignment checklists into in-car copilots and air-quality monitoring systems, then feeds the reports back to the team.

**What we build together**

- On-device RAG + RLHF evaluation scripts
- Safety prompt benchmarks built on environmental datasets
- Deployment strategies that satisfy both Korean and US regulations

Whenever I'm in Seoul we host community sessions together to recruit new collaborators.
