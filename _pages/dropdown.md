This little launcher mirrors the way my collaborators navigate my work. The bookshelf tracks the research and fiction that fuel my thinking, Civic Lab Notes documents prototyping efforts with municipal partners, Blog rounds up essays on AI for public interest, and News keeps a tidy digest of milestones.
